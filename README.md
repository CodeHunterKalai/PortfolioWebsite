### Final advice (don’t ignore this)
- **Add screenshots** → instant credibility
- **Add a live demo link** → non-negotiable
- Replace “optional” tools with what you *actually used*
- Keep README **professional**, not decorative

If you want, next I can:
- Rewrite this README to be **ATS/recruiter-optimized**
- Align it with your **resume projects section**
- Make it sound **senior**, not beginner

Say the word.
